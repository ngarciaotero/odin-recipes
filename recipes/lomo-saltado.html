    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      Lomo saltado is a Peruvian stir-fry dish that typically consists of thinly
      sliced beef, onions, tomatoes, french fries, and soy sauce. The dish
      originated in the 19th century as an adaptation of Chinese stir-fry
      techniques brought over by Chinese immigrants to Peru. The use of
      ingredients like tomato and potato demonstrates the fusion between Chinese
      cooking methods and Peruvian ingredients. Now a beloved staple of home
      cooking and restaurants across Peru, lomo saltado showcases the culinary
      mestizaje, or mixing, that characterizes much of Peruvian cuisine today.

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the steak,
        season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned, 5-6 minutes. Remove
        from the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same pan, then add the red
        onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until softened and browned. Add the
        tomato, garlic, and aji amarillo paste, and cook for another 5-7
        minutes, until the tomatoes have released some of their juices, but are
        still intact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the soy sauce and vinegar and stir to combine, let cook for 1
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the steak, fries, and cilantro. Toss gently to coat the fries in the
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with rice, if desired</li>
    </ol>

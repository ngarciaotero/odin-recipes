    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      At its core, ceviche consists of raw fish cured in citrus juices, usually
      from lime or bitter orange. The fish is combined with onions, chili
      peppers, sweet potatoes, or cancha corn nuts, and served as a fresh,
      bright seafood cocktail. While ceviche's exact origins are debated, most
      food historians agree it has roots among the ancient Moche and Inca
      civilizations of Peru, where fish was cured in citrus due to lack of
      refrigeration. The dish became popularized when Spanish colonialists
      brought citrus fruits to the region during the 16th century.

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dice shrimp and place into a large glass (non-reactive) bowl. Squeeze 1
        to 1 1/4 cups lime juice from 6 limes over shrimp. Stir to combine then
        cover and marinate in the refrigerator (marinate 1 1/2 to 2 hours for
        raw shrimp or until no longer translucent and marinate 15 minutes for
        cooked shrimp), stirring halfway through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop the vegetables: cucumber, avocado, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno
        and cilantro. A food chopper will make this process much faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        When shrimp are done marinating, add vegetables to the bowl along with
        clamato juice and stir to combine. Serve with hot sauce if desired along
        with tortilla chips or over tostadas.

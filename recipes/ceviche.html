    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      Ceviche is considered one of Peru's national culinary treasures and a
      source of great pride for the country. Consisting of raw fish cured in
      citrus juices, ceviche originated along the coastal regions of Peru, where
      fresh seafood was abundant. The acid from lemon or lime juice "cooks" the
      fish, resulting in a light, refreshing dish accentuated by spices.
      Peruvian ceviche often includes white fish such as sole or flounder
      marinated in lime juice mixed with onions, chilies, sweet potatoes, corn,
      lettuce, avocado and sometimes toasted cancha corn kernels.

    <h5>Steps</h5>

      <li>
        Dice shrimp and place into a large glass (non-reactive) bowl. Squeeze 1
        to 1 1/4 cups lime juice from 6 limes over shrimp. Stir to combine then
        cover and marinate in the refrigerator (marinate 1 1/2 to 2 hours for
        raw shrimp or until no longer translucent and marinate 15 minutes for
        cooked shrimp), stirring halfway through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop the vegetables: cucumber, avocado, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno
        and cilantro. A food chopper will make this process much faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        When shrimp are done marinating, add vegetables to the bowl along with
        clamato juice and stir to combine. Serve with hot sauce if desired along
        with tortilla chips or over tostadas.

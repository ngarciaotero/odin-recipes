    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
      Dim sum is considered one of China's national dishes and an important part
      of Chinese culinary culture. Consisting of small plates of steamed, fried,
      and baked savory dumplings and appetizers, dim sum originated in Cantonese
      teahouses where people would gather to socialize while enjoying tea and
      small snacks. Over time, dim sum developed into a dining experience in its
      own right, with restaurants offering carts piled high with small plates
      that you can choose from. Popular dim sum dishes include siu mai (pork and
      shrimp dumplings), char siu bao (steamed buns filled with sweet barbecued
      pork), turnip cakes, and spring rolls.
